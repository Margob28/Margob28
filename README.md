I am currently working on the contextualisation if the Nigerian English typology known as the Popular Nigerian English. I will appreciate contributions in terms of provision of a corpus or list of corpses of Popular Nigerian English. I am looking for collaborators who are willing to take up the project of contributing to Nigerian English Discourse on the Wikimedia page.You can reach me via the email: gobirmariam@gmail.com
